# indicia-reports
Indicia warehouse reports specific to BRC projects.

Historically, a number of these reports have been stored in the main warehouse repository, https://github.com/Indicia-Team/warehouse. This practise clutters the warehouse for non-BRC users and causes additional releases and updates to the core which are related purely to BRC activity. If the version history of a report is of interest it may be worth checking that repo if the report was moved from there to here.

This module should be cloned to the modules/brc\_reports folder of the warehouse, then enabled in application/config.php. You might like to add modules/brc\_reports to the .git/info/exclude file of the
warehouse repository.
